# Roo Pizzashop tutorial app

This app was created by running the pizzashop.roo Roo script with:

    roo.sh script pizzashop.roo

You will need to have Spring Roo installed to run this script and generate the project. But you don't need Roo to run the tutorial app. This repo gives you convenient access to the app without having to install Roo.
